					<h2>given background</h2>
					<p>Applied AI has been contracted to analyze college football viewership and ticket sales. How can they increase college football viewership (in-person and on tv/internet)?<br><br>We had been provided with information about the viewership from 2019, as well as 2020’s new recruits.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="project emphasis extra">
					<h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
					<p><em>Develop a <strong>DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTION</strong> that will engage new users / viewers. Their solution should include data analysis, strong design thinking, and engineering architecture within the 45 minute time constraint.</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="project emphasis">
					<h1>OUR APPROACH</h1>
					<p><em>My team focused on trying to maintain the current college football audience will also focusing on gaining viewership given the context of COVID-19.</em></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>personas</h2>
					<p>By initially identifying our two main target audiences, we made personas based on each of them to gain a better understanding of their wants, pain points, etc.</p>
					<div>
						<img alt="frank" src="images/ux design/deloitte design jam/frank.png">
						<h3>ultimate fan frank</h3>
						<p><em>“I miss being able to talk about the games with my friends, it’s hard to do that over Facetime while the game going on in the background.”</em></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img alt="sara" src="images/ux design/deloitte design jam/sara.png">
						<h3>social sara</h3>
						<p><em>“Honestly, I have no idea how football works. I just like to tailgate with all my friends.”</em></p>
					</div>
					<button id="personas">full personas</button>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>features</h2>
					<p>After creating a better understanding of our intended audience, the team focused on generating features that would address the needs and wants of both user groups.</p>
					<div></div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/ux design/deloitte design jam/trivia.png" alt="screenshot with trivia feature">
						<h3>trivia feature</h3>
						<p>For the already existing college football superfan, we created a trivia feature to be played during ad breaks or just during their free time by integrating the data we were given.<br><br>Further incentives for the superfan to appreciate this feature include a leadership board to compete with their other superfan friends. Additionally, by playing trivia, users can win prizes such as college football merchandise. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="images/ux design/deloitte design jam/chat.png" alt="screenshot with chat feature">
						<h3>chat feature</h3>
						<p>For the users that only go to football games for the social experience, we developed a chat feature to recreate the social aspect of going to an in person college football game.<br><br>Users can choose to chat with preexisting friends or to be matched with strangers during each advertisement break. </p>
