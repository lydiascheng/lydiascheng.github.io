		<h1>LYDIA CHENG</h1>
		<p>I am a  junior studying  at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor at the School of Information studying Information with a specialization in UX design. I am also minoring in Computer Science and Asian Languages and Cultures (Chinese)<br><br>I started off as a neuroscience major my freshman year before deciding that the major was not aligned with my career goals. Then, during my winter semester during freshman year, I took a graphic design class for fun and decided that I wanted to go in a more creative route. From that particular class, I also learned about the School of Information (UMSI)and changed my entire scheudle for my sophmore fall schedule the day before my registration, so I could apply to transfer into UMSI.<br><br>Since making the decision to pursue UX design, I have made a significant effort towards pursuing my goal. Since I come a neuroscience background, I have a strong backgroudn in the psychology necessary to understand user needs. Furthermore, I ended up liking computer science, which I took to apply to UMSI, that I also decided to pursue a computer science minor. Additionally, I focused on improving my visual design skills through various clubs and graphic design internships</p>
